# Burgers - Computational modelling identifies primary mediators of crosstalk between DNA damage and oxidative stress responses.

This repository contains the code and data to reproduce "Computational modelling identifies primary mediators of crosstalk between DNA damage and oxidative stress responses."

**Data** contains the processed data that was used to calibrate the models and make the manuscript figures.

**FittingResults** contains the parameter values found during the parameter calibration process.

**Scripts** contains the scripts required for simulating the models, and generating the manuscript figures. The subfolder _Parameter fitting_ contains the files for the parameter calibration process.
