# This file contains a the input for the ParameterOptimization.py fitting script. 
# This file contains a system of ODEs, the steady states constraints, the information on the observables, 
# the parameters and user settings for the fitting script. 
#
# The three sections for settings, parameters and ODEs are separated by "####START_XXX####" and "####END_XXX####". 
# These separations are read by the fitting script and should therefore not be deleted!
#
# The format is as follows:
#
# Section 1: User settings. 
# This section contains information on the parameter fitting settings, such as number of parameter sets and cores to use, 
# but also the names of the columns that are used to read in the data.
#
# Section 2: Parameters.
# 
# Section 3: ODEs and observable functions.
#
#### Example file for equations:
####
#### # ODE equations
#### f0 = s + kmin * V - kplus * U - du * U
#### f1 = kplus * U - kmin * V - dv * V
####
#### # Steady state constraints
#### fR1 = ((s + (kmin * Vo)) / Uo ) - kplus # solved for du
#### fR2 = ((kplus * Uo) / Vo) - kmin # solved for dv
####
#### # Equations for the observables
#### g0 = sp_U * U + op_U
#### g1 = sp_V * V + op_V

#

# should be the same column name as the realTimeColName.
# Example: < interpolTimeColName = "time" >

# Name of the column in the data set that contains the information on the names of the state variables as string.
# Example: < stateVarName = "variable" >
#

# Name of the column in the data set that contains the information on the concentration as string.

# doses, state variables or replicates.
# Give the names of the replicates/plateIDs per state variable in the data. The replicates/plateIDs of every 
# state variable are contained in a list and all these lists are elements of a bigger list.
# If no replicates, use [] or None. The plateIDName should then also be empty.

# Example: < doseList = [0,10,100] >
#

# So far, only the expDecay option is tested.
# Example: < doseFunctionType = "expDecay" >

# SD handling: if the sd is 0 for one or multiple timepoints, how should this be treated?
# In case there is no data at a timepoint, the sd is NaN and the values in the Jacobian and cost funtion become zero.
# The SD can become zero for multiple reasons:
# Only one replicate exists for one/few timepoints of that variable
# Only one replicate exists for all timepoints of that variable
# Replicates are equal (very unlikely)
# Replicates are equal due to normalisation
# Something else...
# Cosequently, this determines the way you want to handle the SD, for example: 
# Very small SD ("Small_Sd")
# Very large SD ("Large_Sd")
# SD nan ("Nan_Sd")
# SD equal to average SD for that variable ("Average_Sd")
# SD equal to other chosen value ("Input_Sd", sdvalue must be equal to chosen value)
# Something else...
